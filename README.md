**@qsocket/transport-engine.io-v3** is a wrapper package for the [engine.io](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io) library, specifically version **3**. This package is designed for projects that require `engine.io@3.6.2` for compatibility with the **qsocket** library, allowing `engine.io@3.6.2` to coexist with other versions in the same project.

This package can be used independently with **[@qsocket/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qsocket/core)**, the main library core. To simplify installation, all transports are gathered in **[@qsocket/transport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qsocket/transport)**, which includes all officially supported transport packages.

> For a comprehensive package that bundles the core and all transports, consider using **[@qsocket/framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qsocket/framework)**.

### Installation

To install this package, run:

```bash
npm install @qsocket/transport-engine.io-v3
```
